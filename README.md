- [ ] Swaps out anything googleapi :(  https://www.google.com/search?q=%E5%A2%99%E5%86%85+jquery+min&oq=%E5%A2%99%E5%86%85+jquery+min&aqs=chrome..69i57j33.1636j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

- [ ] Larger font size for small screens at all places.

- [ ] Aligns that Douban icon with the other icons at the footer.


- [ ] Upgrades the template to Bootstrap 4 (or build my own template).
- [ ] Shows latest tweets on a page; candidate library: https://github.com/jasonmayes/Twitter-Post-Fetcher.
