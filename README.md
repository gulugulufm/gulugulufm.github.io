Homepage for Gulugulufm.

## TODO 
- [x] Cards display the proper amount of text (just title, timestamp, and audio length).
- [x] Displays ways to listen (a list of icons like Google podcasts) on the home page.
- [x] Adds all SNS links to the home page.
- [x] Completes the about page.
- [x] Adds icons (calendar, timer etc) to card display.
- [x] Completes page: participate in the podcast (be our guest).
- [x] Quick SEO -- keywords, description and everything else.

- [ ] Prettifies the guests page. Each guest should have a profile picture, links to their online presence, and short bio.
- [ ] Extracts a layout for posts -- it should have things like intro, audio, guests.
- [ ] Prettifies the audio player; good ones: https://byte.coffee/60, and soundcloud.
- [ ] Aligns that Douban icon with the other icons at the footer.
- [ ] Shows latest tweets on a page; candidate library: https://github.com/jasonmayes/Twitter-Post-Fetcher.
